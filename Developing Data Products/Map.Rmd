Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

```{r}
library(leaflet)
map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() 
map <- map %>% addMarkers(lat = 45, lng=25, popup="Random")
map
```
